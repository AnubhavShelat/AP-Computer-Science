The Walrus and the Carpenter
	Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
	Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
	And waited in a row.

"The time has come," the Walrus said,
	"To talk of many things;
Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --
	Of cabbages -- and kings --
And why the sea is boiling hot --
	And whether pigs have wings."

"For some of us are out of breath,
	And all of us are fat!"

"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
	"Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
	Are very good indeed --
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
	We can begin to feed."

"The night is fine," the Walrus said.
	Do you admire the view?"

The Carpenter said nothing but
	"The butter's spread too thick!"

"I weep for you," the Walrus said:
	"I deeply sympathize."
With sobs and tears he sorted out
	Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
	Before his streaming eyes.

	But answer came there none --
And this was scarcely odd because
	They'd eaten every one.
